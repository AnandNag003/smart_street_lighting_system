# smart_street_lighting_system
The project aims were to reduce the side effects of the current street lighting system, and find a solution to save power. In this project the first thing to do, is to prepare the inputs and outputs of the system to control the lights of the street. The prototype as shown in Fig has been implemented and works as expected and will prove to be very useful and will fulfil all the present constraints if implemented on a large scale. This IoT Based smart intelligent lighting system for smart city which includes LDR, IR Sensor, Current Sensor, PIC microcontroller, Intel Galileo Gen2 Board, Wifi Module, Relays.
